# notes-app

## Challenge

In this challenge I developed a full-blown applications running inside the user browser, while leveraging what I've learned so far about JS to communicate with backend APIs.

The notes-app challenge has been 100% completed, including the use of an Emoji Api.

### Learning objectives

1. Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
2. Use the DOM API to manipulate the web page structure and content.
3. Use fetch to send HTTP requests to a remote server.

### Getting started

git clone the repo

### Setup

Whilst in the root directory:

1. Enter 'npm install' in the terminal to install the dependencies.

2. Enter 'npm run build' in the terminal to bundle the JavaScript files.

3. Open the HTMl page via the terminal. Mac: 'open index.html' or Linux: 'google-chome index.html'

### Test Code

Run Jest in the terminal with the 'jest' command from the root directory to test the code.
